# PySROS example to provision BGP peering and policies

This Python script uses [PySROS](https://github.com/nokia/pysros) to provision BGP peers and prefix lists based on PeeringDB and IRR data.

## Run example
(assumes you have the lab topology up and running)
```
make
```

This creates a virtual environment, installs the dependencies and launches the sample script
